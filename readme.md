## 🎯 What I Do

I'm that rare breed who speaks both **boardroom** and **backend**. Currently pursuing my MBA at Delhi School of Business while building technical solutions that actually solve real business problems.

**My Superpower?** Translating "We need better insights" into production-ready dashboards, and "This takes too long" into automated workflows that save 87% of manual effort.

### The Tech-Business Bridge
- 📊 **Business Side:** Managed ₹5Cr+ portfolio, led cross-functional teams, drove go-to-market strategies
- 💻 **Tech Side:** Python automation, API integrations, ML models, cloud backends
- 🚀 **The Magic:** Combining both to build solutions that actually get used (and loved) by business teams
